I tried to format as much of the data as I could in python. The only thing I couldn't figure out was how to autofit columns after exporting the data from the dataframe. Everything else is formatted in the code
and the orignal dataframe is in the code as 'df'. The columns should be fitted in the version I send after I went into Excel and fitted them.
